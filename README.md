### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 My name is Rawan Aboughanem, and I am a student at Grand Blanc High School. I plan to graduate highschool and go into medical school at a university, I want to study life sciences and protentoially be a dentist or dermatologist. I am interested in helping people but get a bit grossed out sometimes, therefore I am unsure about what I want to do for certain, howebver I have an idea of it. Now, here's some facts about me:

 - I am very commited to my school.

 - I can read and write both English and Arabic.

 - I am good with kids and have babysat before.

 - I am currently in NHS, and advanced class in school.
